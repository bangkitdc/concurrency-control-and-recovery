```
Go to ./twopl or ./mvcc
usage: python {twopl.py, mvcc.py} [pathfile]

Concurrency Control Protocol Implementation

positional arguments:
  {twopl.py, mvcc.py}  choose concurrency control protocol
  [pathfile]           path file for the testcase, use file in ./test

example:
  python twopl.py twopl_tc1.txt
